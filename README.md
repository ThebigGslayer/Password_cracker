# Password Cracker (Dictionary Attack Simulator)

The **Password Cracker** is a Python-based tool that simulates a dictionary attack using a wordlist to guess a target password. 
Built with a simple GUI using Tkinter, the tool demonstrates how weak passwords can be cracked using automated methods. This project is designed for 
learners to understand the practical risks of using common or simple passwords.
